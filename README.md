*DOMAIN*: Data Analytics

*DURATION*: 4 WEEKS

*MENTOR*: NEELA SANTOSH

*DESCRIPTION*:Strengths:

The code is well-organized and clearly commented, making it easy to follow step by step.

It demonstrates two different machine learning approaches (classification and regression) in a single script, which shows versatility.

The use of train_test_split ensures proper evaluation of the classification model.

Visualization of polynomial regression with Matplotlib is excellent â€” it makes the concept much easier to understand.

Printing coefficients, accuracy, and predicted actions provides useful insights into model behavior.

âš¡ Suggestions for Improvement:

The classification dataset is very small (only 10 rows). For more meaningful accuracy, you could use a larger dataset (e.g., Iris dataset from Scikit-learn).

For the regression part, you could evaluate the fit quality using metrics like RÂ² score or Mean Squared Error (MSE).

Consider wrapping the code into functions or classes for reusability and cleaner structure.

Adding a comparison between different classifiers (e.g., Decision Tree vs Logistic Regression) would make the analysis even stronger.

ðŸ”¹ Libraries Used

pandas â†’ For handling tabular data in DataFrame format.

numpy â†’ For numerical computations, polynomial fitting, and array operations.

matplotlib.pyplot â†’ For visualizing data and regression curves.

sklearn.model_selection (train_test_split) â†’ For splitting the dataset into training and test sets.

sklearn.tree (DecisionTreeClassifier) â†’ For training a decision tree classification model.

sklearn.metrics (accuracy_score) â†’ For evaluating the classification model.

ðŸŒŸ Overall Feedback

This program is a very good demonstration of machine learning fundamentals. It successfully shows how to build, train, and evaluate a classification model and also how to fit and visualize a regression model. The use of multiple libraries reflects strong practical knowledge. With some improvements in dataset size and evaluation metrics, this project could serve as an excellent academic or professional portfolio example.
